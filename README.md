#🛡️ TrustTrace: Radical Transparency for the Social Sector
*"Moving from Blind Faith to Verified Impact."*

TrustTrace is a 2026-vision platform designed to eliminate the 'Black Box' of NGO donations. By implementing a **Live Financial Ledger, Geotagged Proof of Work*, and *AI-Driven Impact Reporting**, we turn every donation into a traceable journey.

##🛑 The Problem: The "Trust Deficit"
In India, donors often hesitate to contribute due to:
-**Lack of Visibility**: No way to know if ₹5,000 bought school kits or paid for office rent.
-**Static Reports**: Annual reports are outdated and easily manipulated.
-**Verification Gaps**: Difficulty in validating the ground reality of remote NGO projects.

##💡 The Solution: The "Glass-Box" Approach
TrustTrace treats a donation like a high-priority order. We provide:
1. Live Financial Ledger (₹): Real-time tracking of expenses with clickable Vendor Receipts.
2. The Donation "Impact Timeline": A dynamic tracker showing: Received → Allocated → Executed → Verified.
3. Proof of Impact: A gallery of field photos with hardcoded Geotags (GPS) and timestamps.
4. AI Impact Insights: Automated data visualization showing fund utilization and quarterly trends.

##🛠️ Tech Stack
-**Frontend Framework**: React 18 with Vite for ultra-fast HMR.
-**Type Safety**: TypeScript for robust, error-free development.
-**UI Components**: Shadcn UI (Radix UI primitives) for accessible, high-performance components.
-**Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design.
-**Data Strategy**: Simulated 2025-2026 transaction ledger using a robust JSON schema.

##🚀 Key Features & Innovation
###🏢 NGO Explorer & Trust Score
Browse verified NGOs filtered by Category (Education, Health, etc.) and Region. Each NGO carries a **Trust Score (1-100)** calculated based on overhead ratios, audit history, and direct beneficiary feedback.

###💰 Transparent Donation Flow
-**Project-Specific Giving**: Choose to fund a "General Fund" or a specific "Milestone" (e.g., Project: Digital Literacy).
-**Instant Tax Compliance**: Mock 80G receipt generation upon successful donation.
-**Anonymity Mode**: Toggle to hide your name from the public donor list.

###📊 The Post-Donation Dashboard (The "Winner" Feature)
Once you donate, the site transforms for you:
-**Your Impact Timeline**: Appears instantly to show where your specific rupees are in the NGO’s supply chain.
-**Live Ledger Access**: View actual vendor invoices (e.g., Invoice from Reliance Digital for 10 Tablets).
-**AI Summary**: A generated report explaining exactly how the NGO’s efficiency has improved this quarter.

###📸 Integrity Tools
-**Field Evidence**: Geotagged images from the site of work.
-**Grievance Portal**: A built-in system for donors or locals to report discrepancies, directly affecting the NGO's Trust Score.

##🏗️ How to Run
1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/rishita-git-05/trusttrace
2. Install: npm install
3. Launch: npm run dev

##🔮 Future Roadmap (The Vision)
-**Blockchain Immutability**: Migrating the mock ledger to a public L2 (Polygon) for 100% tamper-proof records.
-**IoT Integration**: Using smart sensors (e.g., water flow sensors on a new well) to feed real-time impact data directly to the dashboard.
-**Smart Milestone Funding**: Funds are only released to the NGO's wallet once a "Proof of Work" photo is verified by AI.
